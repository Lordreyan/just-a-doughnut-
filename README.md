## Project Description

The Doughnut Rotator is a Python script that enables the rotation of a doughnut shape. It utilizes mathematical calculations and visualization libraries to perform the rotation and display the resulting animation. This script can be used to create visually appealing and dynamic representations of doughnuts.

This project is implemented in Python and leverages libraries such as NumPy and Matplotlib for numerical computations and visualization.
